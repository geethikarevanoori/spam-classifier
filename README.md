# Spam Classifier

A spam classifier built using machine learning techniques to detect spam messages from legitimate ones.

## Project Description

This project implements a spam classifier using natural language processing and machine learning models. It uses a dataset of text messages to train a model that classifies whether a message is spam or not.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/geethikarevanoori/spam-classifier.git

## Dataset

This project uses the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** from Kaggle for training the model. You can download the dataset by following these steps:

1. Go to the [Kaggle SMS Spam Collection Dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).
2. Sign in to your Kaggle account (if you haven't already).
3. Click on the **Download** button to get the dataset.

After downloading, place the dataset file (`SMSSpamCollection`) in the `data/` folder of this repository (or any location of your choice).
